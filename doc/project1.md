Task 1: Argument Passing

Task 2: Process Control Syscalls

Task 3: File Operation Syscalls

  All file operation syscalls are handled by the syscall_handler function in syscall.c. Thus, to know if a user is calling a  file operation, we will check if args[0] is equal to any of the following: {SYS_CREATE, SYS_REMOVE, SYS_OPEN, SYS_FILESIZE, SYS_READ, SYS_WRITE, SYS_SEEK, SYS_TELL, SYS_CLOSE}. Once we identify which file operation a user is calling we will call the file_operation_handler function (define below) which handles synchronization and validates the user's arguments. If the arguments are valid, file_operation_handler will then use Pintos file system to perform the requested task.
  
  
  
  To synchronize the file system operations system we will use a global lock.
